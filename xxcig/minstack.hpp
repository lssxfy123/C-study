/******************************************************************************
 * File: MinStack.hpp
 * Author: Keith Schwarz (htiek@cs.stanford.edu)
 *
 * A LIFO stack class that supports O(1) push, pop, and find-min.  Here, the
 * find-min operation returns (but does not remove) the minimum value in the
 * stack.  This sort of stack is often used as a subroutine in other problems.
 * It can be used to construct a queue with equivalent properties by
 * using one of the many stack-to-queue constructions, for example.
 *
 * The implementation of the min-stack is actually quite simple.  The idea is
 * that since the stack can only grow and shrink at the top, we only need to
 * consider two ways that the minimum element of the stack can change:
 *
 *  1. The minimum element is on the top, and it is popped off, and
 *  2. A new element is added to the stack that is smaller than the minimum.
 *
 * Because of this, we can augment a standard stack to track the minimum value
 * as follows.  Whenever we push an element atop the stack, we compare it to
 * the current minimum value.  If it is smaller, we augment the value we just
 * added into the stack by recording that it is the minimum.  If not, we store
 * a pointer down to the element of the stack that actually is the minimum.  In
 * this way, we can find the minimum element in constant time by simply
 * inspecting the top element of the stack and following its pointer to the
 * minimum element.
